# wireframe-render-python
A 3d wireframe render built entirely with python using pygame, a 2d graphics library. 

One of my most complex and ambitious projects. Taught me a lot about 3d rendering. 
Renders different 3d shapes using wireframes.
Allows users to perform many different transformations on them, such as:
1. Rotations
2. Enlargements
3. Color changes
4. Focal length changes

Wireframes are provided but you are able to make your own wireframes. Most wireframes provided are built with chatGPT help.
Wireframes provided are: 
1. Cube
2. Pyramid
3. Tetrahedron
4. Triangular Prism
5. Hexagonal Prism
6. Hexagonal Pyramid
7. L-shape Prism
   
Uses a rendering method called 'weak perspective projection': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection 

Program has numerous bugs which I have been unable to solve:
  1. when rotating wireframe, it becomes slightly deformed. Not noticable unless you rotate wireframe a lot.
  2. from some angles wireframe does not look proportinate or realistic. Fault of rendering technique, I believe. 

Program would probably seem very inefficient and poorly written to skilled coders reading this.
